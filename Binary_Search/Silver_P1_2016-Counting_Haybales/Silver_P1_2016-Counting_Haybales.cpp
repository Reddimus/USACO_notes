Counting Haybales - USACO Silver P1 2016 prompt:

Farmer John has just arranged his N haybales (1≤N≤100,000) at various points along 
the one-dimensional road running across his farm. To make sure they are spaced out 
appropriately, please help him answer Q queries (1≤Q≤100,000), each asking for the 
number of haybales within a specific interval along the road.

INPUT FORMAT (file haybales.in):
The first line contains N and Q.

The next line contains N distinct integers, each in the range 0…1,000,000,000, 
indicating that there is a haybale at each of those locations.

Each of the next Q lines contains two integers A and B (0≤A≤B≤1,000,000,000) 
giving a query for the number of haybales between A and B, inclusive.

OUTPUT FORMAT (file haybales.out):
You should write Q lines of output. For each query, output the number of haybales 
in its respective interval.

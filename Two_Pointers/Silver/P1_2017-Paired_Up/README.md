## [Problem 1. Paired Up](https://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=738)

Farmer John finds that his cows are each easier to milk when they have another cow nearby for moral support. He therefore wants to take his M cows (Mâ‰¤1,000,000,000, M even) and partition them into M/2 pairs. Each pair of cows will then be ushered off to a separate stall in the barn for milking. The milking in each of these M/2 stalls will take place simultaneously.

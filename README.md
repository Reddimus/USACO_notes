# Welcome to USACO

The **USA Computing Olympiad (USACO)** is a prestigious computer programming competition aimed at high school students in the United States. It serves as a platform to help students enhance their problem-solving skills and knowledge of data structures and algorithms.

## Competition Tiers

Participants progress through four increasingly challenging stages:
- **Bronze:** The entry-level stage for beginners.
- **Silver:** Intermediate level that builds upon the basics.
- **Gold:** Advanced level requiring more sophisticated algorithms.
- **Platinum:** The highest level featuring the most complex problems.

Competitions occur several times a year, culminating in the selection of the top 12 students from the Platinum stage to attend the USA IOI training camp in May. From there, four students are chosen to represent the USA at the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) held in July.

## Getting Started with USACO

To embark on your USACO journey, follow these steps:
1. Sign up at the [USACO website](http://www.usaco.org/).
2. Set up your coding environment with an IDE or text editor. Consider [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/).
3. Ensure you can run code in [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [C++](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/binaries.html), or [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
4. Start with practice problems from past contests.
5. Test your solutions locally before submitting them on the USACO website.

## Roadmaps for Success
